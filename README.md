WordPress StackExchange
=========

Hat tip to [Christopher Davis](https://github.com/chrisguitarguy/WPSE-Plugins) for inspiring me to catalogue my contribution to the WordPress StackExchange forums. This repo is full of things I've written to help answer questions there. (Migrating away from gist sources for organizational and promotion reasons).

You can find me active on the [WPSE](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/28798/codearachnid). If you have a comment or recommendation leave an issue to this repo. I appreciate pull requests to improve.
